  <h1 align="center">HTML</h1>
    <p>
HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language.HTML was created in 1990, by a man named Tim Berners-Lee. Berners-Lee had help from Robert Calliau funding the project. Hypertext is how you navigate
throughout web pages. Hyper-links which use hypertext, are used to help navigate quickly to another web page. The word hyper in hypertext means that it is not linear, meaning you have the freedom
to go to any web page you would like to, at any time. Markup controls how your HTML tags affect the text, you can bold, underline, italicize text and much more. Since HTML is a coding language, just
like all others there is a certain syntax you must follow. The elements and code you type in your text file will shape the web page the way you tell it to, you must save your text file as "example.HTML" and then it can
be opened in a web browser.

HTML5 was released on October 28, 2014 and is based off of HTML, except it is newer and has cut out a lot of strict rules HTML had. HTML5 has a major difference than the older HTML with better audio and video support.
In HTML5 JavaScript runs in the background instead of in the browser interface thread. Most of these new changes have made it a lot easier for developers to make web pages accessible to mobile users.
HTML5 has added more code and is continuing to add more and more code every day that will be available to all developers. Essentially HTML5 has just made HTML an easier language in many different
ways, from storing data and simply makes running HTML run smoother on mobile devices and computers.

    <p>
CSS is a style sheet language that can in detail alter your web page. CSS was first established on October 10, 1994 by a man named Hakon Wilum Lie. There were many other style sheet languages before
but CSS was designed to work on web pages. Although there had been style sheets hard coded into HTML, CSS was a separate structure allowing developers to alter presentation for printing, screen-based
presentations, and editors. CSS is not only used to style web pages but can also be applied to other markup languages. CSS is a very important language to learn if you are a web developer, along with
knowing HTML and JavaScript.
